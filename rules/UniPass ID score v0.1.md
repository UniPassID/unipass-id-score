# Introduction of UniPass ID Score

UniPass ID score is dedicated to creating a real and credible score for each web3 user.

The most basic thing of identity score is the trustworthiness of the identity. How to ensure that behind each identity corresponds to a real user is a very difficult thing. We can only increase the difficulty of forging an identity by adding more authentication methods for the identity, at the same time we also need to ensure that all our authentication methods are decentralized, not to import any additional centralized verification agencies.

 

The base calculation rule of the ID score is the authenticity of the identity multiplied by the evaluation dimensions of the identity. The authenticity of the identity is ensured by cryptographic verification on blockchain, and the evaluation will be developed from multiple dimensions around the identity, including address, assets, governance, etc.

**UniPass** **ID Score = Identity authentic factor * Identity evaluation dimensions**

ðŸ’¡ Note: the rules and dimensions related to ID score are still undergoing rapid iteration and will be continuously adjusted and optimized in the future.

## Identity authentic factor

Authenticity of identity is crucial to the identity evaluation system.

| Authentic Verification | Factor |
| --- | --- |
| UniPass registration | + 1 |
| Verified email | + 0.25 |
| Verified twitter | To be listed |
| ... | ... |

## Identity evaluation dimensions

| Evaluation Dimensions | Ratio |
| --- | --- |
| Basic identity | 40% |
| Defi evaluation | 20% |
| NFT evalution | 20% |
| Community governance | To be listed |
| Social network | 10% |
| Verification & Activity | 10% |

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: At present, only assets and NFTs on Ethereum would be counted, and more blockchainsâ€˜ data will continue to be integrated in the future.
